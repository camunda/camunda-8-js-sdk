/**
 * These are decorators and infrastructure that are used to create Dtos for the Camunda 8 SDK.
 * A `LosslessDto` is used to represent data that is sent and received by the SDK - including job variables and headers.
 * They enable the lossless transformation of `int64` number values between the SDK and the Camunda 8 API â€”
 * representing the `int64` numbers as either `string` or `bigint` type in the SDK.
 *
 * See the {@link LosslessDto} for more information.
