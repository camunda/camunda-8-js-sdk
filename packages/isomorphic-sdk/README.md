# Camunda 8 Isomorphic SDK

This SDK runs on Node 18+ and in modern web browsers. It also supports server-side rendering (SSR).

If you need to use custom certificates (such as self-signed certificates), then you will need to use `@camunda8/sdk` and run on Node. Custom certificates are not supported in the browser.
